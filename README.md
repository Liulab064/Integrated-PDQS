# Integrated-PDQS
We have developed a Private Data Query System (PDQS) that allows users to monetise their personal data while ensuring privacy protection. This project incorporates techniques such as mechanism design, differential privacy, neural networks, and reinforcement learning. The code was authored by Weidong Li and LiboZhang.
